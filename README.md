# Personal Portfolio Website
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/_LeruIYYEV0
#### Description:
  This website is an accumulation of the skills learned during the CS50 program in addition to additional practice with javascript and css. This website acts as a portfolio of me and who I am as a person, with a built-in html based form meant for communication purposes.
  
  Within this project, there are many css, js, and html files used for website functionality and overall look of the final product. To begin the index.html file holds the majority of the website's information, with a navbar (used throughout the website), a header, a projects section, an interests section, and a footer with a link to the form. Within this file are links to bootstrap css which is used for formatting as well as the navbar. In order to achieve the "typewriter" effect on the front of the page, a built-in js script is used that edits the element after an interval to create the effect. This page contains a variety of buttons with different styles, transitions, and text highlighting to make the website feel more interactive to the user. The projects section of index.html contains clickable links which allow for the user to look more into what the project is about and how/when it was completed. The clickable links lead to ResearchProject.html and Solar-Assistant.html
  
   The form.html file contains a form that once submitted, sends the user's input to my email address for review and further contact. This page contains the same navbar as the previous. The file success.html is is shown to the user after submission of the form.
   The about.html file contains an about page which describes more about myself and why I created the website in the first place
   
   Most of the css files within this project were used in order to import fonts, utulize transitions, and allow for further styling. These css files were not created by me but make the website look much cleaner and sophisticated overall. The style.css file contains the styling for the project with many different sections and use-cases. The javascript files are used for transitions and text-underlining/highlighting and were not created by me.
   
   This project uses an accumulation of inspiration from other sources and css/js files that are imported here for easier use. Files not created by me have attribution at the top of them. This website is live at aleksandergarbuz.com and is used as a portfolio website outlaying the skills that I learned during my time at CS50
